**🚀Project Highlight: Creating and Mounting an Amazon EFS File System using Amazon EC2 Launch Instance Wizard 🌐**


💥 Recently, I explored a practical scenario where I set up an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) and mounted it to an EC2 instance using the EC2 Launch Instance Wizard. 💫 This project was a hands-on experience in understanding the seamless integration of scalable file storage with compute resources on AWS.

**These are the steps that I have taken in this project:**


✅ Creating the EFS File System: Initiated an EFS in a designated VPC, configuring it for multi-AZ availability and optimal performance for general-purpose workloads.

✅ Security Group Configuration: Ensured that the security groups allowed NFS traffic between the EC2 instance and the EFS file system, maintaining secure access.

✅ Launching the EC2 Instance: Used the Launch Instance Wizard to spin up an EC2 instance with the necessary IAM role and security group settings for EFS access.

✅ Mounting the EFS: After launching the instance, I securely mounted the EFS file system using the provided mount instructions, ensuring persistent and scalable storage directly accessible from the EC2 instance.

This project reinforced my understanding of AWS's powerful storage solutions and how they can be seamlessly integrated into cloud infrastructure to meet the demands of various applications.
